# .gitignore manual check
When publishing for production, 
 * review or ask your agent to
   "review .gitignore" and ensure that this repo can be pulled from github intact and executed. Otherwise remove blocking ".gitignore" messages and detail what was removed and why."

   or add it to your production deployment workflow
